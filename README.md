## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the stats-base-ndarray-variance project! This software helps you compute the variance of a one-dimensional ndarray easily. Variance is a key concept in statistics, measuring how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average. 

This guide will walk you through the steps to download and use the software, even if you're not a programmer.

## 📦 System Requirements
To run this application, ensure your computer meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
